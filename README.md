## Project Description:
The aim of the project is to extend the list of supported classification algorithms in SparkR by new algorithm called Z-KNN, which is an alternative for distributed k-nearest neighbors classifier introduced in the following paper ["A Distributed K Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Big Data"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324833142_A_Distributed_K_Nearest_Neighbor_Classifier_for_Big_Data) by Tamer Tulgar and others.
